# An Analysis of Uk Marriage and Divorce Rates 

With the use of the Office of National statistics (ONS) data, I was able to collate and create a number of visual models that were used to observe, analyse and compare marriage and divorce rates within a 50-year timeframe.

## Lessons Learned frequently than men but the amounts of divorce rates over the previous decade before (i.e. 2005-2014) are dropping. 

During this data analysis project, I've learned many things such as, women in the UK not only intiate divorce much than men. Overall, divorce have dropped significnatly,  over the past 20 year timeframe (i.e. 1990-2010) and the divorce rates continue to drop, which does paint a more optimsitic outlook on future UK marriage prospects. Nevertheless, It will be interesting to see how the current data compares to this study.
